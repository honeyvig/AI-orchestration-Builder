# AI-orchestration-Builder
Python code to design and implement multi-agent AI systems that automate workflows, integrating various tools like n8n.com, make.com, Airtable, and utilizing Relevance AI for workflow automation. Here's a broad outline of how to approach this task, followed by some example Python code that demonstrates how these systems could be integrated.

To implement such a solution, you'd need to consider the following:

    Multi-Agent Systems (MAS): The agents will act independently but will communicate and collaborate for a common goal.
    Workflow Automation Tools: n8n, make.com, and Airtable are tools that will integrate different services, APIs, and trigger workflows.
    Relevance AI for Workflow Orchestration: Relevance AI could help orchestrate complex workflows by managing decision-making processes.

I'll break it down into steps, and then provide a Python-based skeleton for connecting and automating these tools.
Steps:

    Design Multi-Agent Architecture: Each agent can be responsible for a certain task (e.g., data processing, sending/receiving information from Airtable, triggering workflows).
    Set Up Workflows in n8n or Make.com: These tools can automate processes by connecting services, triggering actions based on conditions or data inputs.
    Integrate with Airtable: Use Airtableâ€™s API to store and retrieve data that the agents need to operate on.
    Use Relevance AI for Coordination: Relevance AI can manage and process tasks and trigger different agents based on certain conditions or logic.
    Automation and Monitoring: Implement a Python script to trigger workflows, track agent status, and monitor their performance.

Example Python Code Skeleton:

This Python code assumes you're integrating Airtable, n8n, and Relevance AI with a simple workflow automation setup.

First, install the required packages:

pip install requests
pip install airtable-python-wrapper

Python Code Example:

import requests
from airtable import Airtable
import json

# Airtable API setup
AIRTABLE_API_KEY = 'your_airtable_api_key'
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID = 'your_airtable_base_id'
AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME = 'your_airtable_table_name'

# n8n API setup
N8N_API_URL = 'http://n8n-instance.com/webhook'
N8N_API_KEY = 'your_n8n_api_key'

# Relevance AI API setup
RELEVANCE_AI_URL = 'https://api.relevance.ai/v1/trigger'
RELEVANCE_API_KEY = 'your_relevance_api_key'

# Function to interact with Airtable
def fetch_data_from_airtable():
    airtable = Airtable(AIRTABLE_BASE_ID, AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME, AIRTABLE_API_KEY)
    records = airtable.get_all()
    data = [record['fields'] for record in records]
    return data

# Function to trigger a workflow in n8n
def trigger_n8n_workflow(payload):
    headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {N8N_API_KEY}', 'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
    response = requests.post(N8N_API_URL, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Workflow triggered successfully!")
    else:
        print(f"Error triggering workflow: {response.status_code}")

# Function to trigger Relevance AI task
def trigger_relevance_ai_task(data):
    headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {RELEVANCE_API_KEY}', 'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
    payload = {
        "task": "optimize_workflow",
        "data": data
    }
    response = requests.post(RELEVANCE_AI_URL, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Relevance AI task triggered successfully!")
    else:
        print(f"Error triggering Relevance AI task: {response.status_code}")

# Main function to orchestrate the process
def orchestrate_workflows():
    # Fetch data from Airtable
    data = fetch_data_from_airtable()
    
    # For each record, trigger the respective workflow (based on the business logic)
    for record in data:
        print(f"Processing record: {record}")
        
        # Trigger n8n workflow based on conditions
        if record.get('status') == 'pending':
            payload = {"data": record}  # Customize payload as per the workflow requirements
            trigger_n8n_workflow(payload)
        
        # Trigger Relevance AI task for optimization or processing
        if record.get('needs_optimization'):
            trigger_relevance_ai_task(record)

# Run the orchestration
if __name__ == '__main__':
    orchestrate_workflows()

Key Concepts Covered:

    Airtable Integration: We fetch data from Airtable using the Airtable Python client and use that data to trigger workflows.
    Triggering n8n Workflows: Using requests to send a POST request to n8n's webhook API, triggering workflows based on the data fetched from Airtable.
    Relevance AI Task Orchestration: We call the Relevance AI API to trigger specific tasks for multi-agent coordination.
    Automation Logic: Based on specific conditions (e.g., 'status' or 'needs_optimization'), we can trigger different actions in workflows.

Next Steps for Implementation:

    Custom Workflow Logic: You can enhance the logic in the orchestrate_workflows function to create complex automation based on different conditions (e.g., task prioritization, agent coordination).
    Testing and Optimization: Ensure each part (Airtable, n8n, and Relevance AI) is correctly configured and tested in a sandbox environment before moving to production.
    Scalability and Efficiency: Implement caching mechanisms or retry logic in case of API failures, and make the system more scalable by managing state and task execution efficiently.

By using this structure, you can integrate multiple systems and create automated workflows for optimizing processes in your AI-based system.
